    <!-- Introduction -->
    <p>One of the things a rower always wants to know: how fast am I? In rowing it is quite hard to compare results. Even if you win, how do you know if your crew has been very fast- or the opponents rather slow? How do you compare a lightweight single to a heavy eight? And what if a regatta has obviously been influenced by the weather?</p>
    <p>This article is about answering some of these questions through visualizations. The data used to draw these graphs is freely available on <a href="https://time-team.nl/informatie/uitslagen" target="blank">Time Team.</a>I will exclusively be using 2000m regattas on The Bosbaan - Amsterdam.</p>
    <p>For those who do not have a basic knowledge about rowing, the collapsible sections will explain more. </p>

        <p>About Regattas, Fields, Heats, Boattypes etc.. </p>
        <p>Regatta is the name of a tournament in rowing. Each of these regattas consist of many different categories in which crews can participate. Every race in a categorie is called a heat. There are many different regattas in The Netherlands. About 10-12 important regattas each year, and many other smaller ones. Most regattas are on a 2000m course- as this is the most important distance in rowing. During worldcups and olympics 2000m is the only distance.
        </p>
        <p>In the following graphs you will see many different codes. From N1x to DDev4-. What you need to know: these codes are Dutch abbreviations for the field a crew is in. The abbreviations consist of three parts:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>Sex / Age: Men, Lightweight men, Women, Lightweight Women</li>
          <li>Category: Starter, Advanced etc. (though it uses other terms)</li>
          <li>Boattype: Single, double, four, eight. These can be sculling (two oars for each person) or sweep (one oar each person). And with or without coxswain (+). A good visualization can be found <a target="blank" href="http://megunticookrowing.org/about/rowing-101">here</a>.</li>
        </ul> 
        <p>
        Examples:<br> A lightweight (L) starter (B) rowing a single (1x): LB1x 
                 <br> Four women (D) rowing a double four (4*) in an "advanced" (O) field: DO4*.
                 <br> Eight men (-) rowing an eight(8+) in the top (SA) heavyweight class: SA8+.

    <p>So- what if you <em>do</em> wonder about the absolute differences between fields? This chart allows you to compare them. Hover over the bars to see more details about every crew.</p>

    <p>Rowing results differ greatly as races are influenced by various factors. Fair comparison between seasons/years, regattas, races and/or people is very hard. In addition, comparing a lightweight novice to an experienced heavyweight would not make any sense, just like comparing a windy winter regatta to and end-of-season summer regatta. Still, by calculating some correction factors it might be possible to (somehow) compare the data.</p>

    <!-- Regatta Scores .. more text -->
    <p>How does the graph work? The scores (0%-100%) are based on the quickest times in the dataset. The averages are based on the finals. </p>
    
    <!-- Lane Advantage header and text -->
    <div class="paragraph_header">Lane Advantage</div>
    <p>Before viewing this graph, it is important to know how the race drawing procedure works. From all sign-ups, a random draw decides which crew starts in which lane. In case there are more crews than lanes (often the case), pre-finals will be rowed.  From the pre-finals, the six quickest teams are promoted to the A-Final. In this final, the quickest crews from the heats are lined up in the middle. All slower crews around the middle. [Example: 6 crews make it to the final, lane [2] to [7] are in use. The quickest crew is ligned up in one of the the middle lanes: [4] or [5]. The other crews are aligned based on their times in the heats. The sides lanes thus sporting the slowest crews.]</p>
    <p>Due to wind conditions, races might not always be as fair as they seem. In general, the quickest crew in the pre-finals has a right to start in the quickest lane. Often, regatta organisation members tend to ignore lane advantage, although it does not exist. Probably because it would involve a lot of hassle and a re-draw.</p>
    <p>The following graph attempts to show lane advantage in different regattas. The bigger the dot, the better a crew rowed. Weather data is based on daily averages at Schiphol and will slighty differ from the actual weather. </p>

    <p>How to intepret this graph? The messier the better. In case you start seeing patterns (Like, one side of the lanes always scoring better than the other lane) : the races probably were not that fair.</p>

    <p>Regatta Scores Chart: [niet alle highscores zijn even 'hoog', omdat sommige boattypes "in" raken. Daar door misschien vertekend beeld.]</p>
    <p>Lane Advantage Chart: Although the lane advantage graph shows average wind factors, these are not the only important factors. Current, water- and air temperature are important as well.. Luckily the air and water temperature are equal for all crews. The water current is harder to measure as these are influenced by wind conditions days before as well. </p>
