Exploring Amsterdams rowing course data.
===========
This website is coded and designed as part of my final project on the University of Amsterdams minor in programming.

The purpose of the website is to give a short introduction on rowing and visually compare the data used in rowing. This version includes exclusively 2000m races rowed Amsterdams rowing course "De Bosbaan".  

The project is published under the MIT license found in the license.md file.
