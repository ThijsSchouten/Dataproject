Bosbaan Rowing Visualization
===========
(c) 2015 Thijs Erik Schouten

The purpose of the project is to give a short introduction on rowing and visually compare the data used in rowing. For now it includes exclusively 2000m races rowed on Amsterdam's rowing course "De Bosbaan".  

The project is published under the MIT license found in the license.md file. Feel free to (re-) use the code in any kind of way - no restrictions.

Code used in this project include: D3.js, jQuery, Google Maps, and Eric Meyer's CSS reset. All of them have their own respective licenses. Data can be found on time-team.nl and knmi.nl. All graphs and images by myself.

Finally, this website is coded and designed as part of my final project on the University of Amsterdam minor in programming.
